# Content and FAQ Enhancement - 2025-08-30

## Objective

To comprehensively enhance the website's content by comparing it against a key competitor (`olivegardenmenue.com`), identifying and filling content gaps, and ensuring all information is accurate, engaging, and aligned with user intent. A major focus was placed on enriching menu data and expanding the FAQ sections across the site.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Menu Page Updates

A full audit of all menu pages was conducted by comparing our JSON data (`raw/*.json`) against the competitor's offerings.

- **Data Enrichment**: Added missing menu items, prices, and calorie counts to the following pages:
  - `drink-menu.json`
  - `lunch-menu.json`
  - `dinner-menu.json`
  - `pasta-menu.json`
  - `soup-menu.json`
- **Pricing Correction**: Updated outdated pricing across all menus, including `dessert-menu.json` and `kids-menu.json`, to reflect current market data.
- **Structural Enhancements**:
  - **`catering-menu.json`**: Restructured the entire page from a single list into nine distinct, user-friendly categories (e.g., Catering Pans, Meal Combinations, Appetizers, Desserts), mirroring the competitor's superior layout and adding dozens of new items.
  - **`pasta-menu.json`**: Created a new "Oven Baked Pastas" category to better organize baked dishes, improving user navigation.
- **Copywriting Enhancements**: Improved the introductory text and category descriptions across all menu pages to align with the "Savvy Foodie Superfan" persona, making the content more engaging and descriptive.

### 2. "Near Me" Page Enhancement

- Added two new data tables to the `near_me.json` page to provide users with valuable and interesting statistics:
  - "Top 10 States with the Most Olive Garden Locations"
  - "Top 10 Cities with the Most Olive Garden Locations"
- This provides users with engaging content beyond a simple location finder.

### 3. FAQ Expansion

- A full audit of the competitor's FAQ was performed.
- Identified and added over a dozen high-value, user-intent-focused questions and answers that were previously missing from our site.
- These new FAQs were strategically distributed to the most relevant pages to provide contextual help to users. Key additions were made to:
  - `dinner-menu.json` (e.g., "Can I customize my meal?", "Are there secret menu items?")
  - `specials.json` (e.g., "What is the best value meal?", "Has Olive Garden brought back any fan-favorites?")
  - `nutrition-allergen-menu.json` (e.g., "Are there vegan options available?")
  - `dessert-menu.json` (e.g., "What dessert should I not skip?")

## Rationale

These changes were implemented to achieve content parity with a major competitor, significantly improve the depth and accuracy of our data, and enhance the overall user experience. By providing more comprehensive menus, more helpful FAQs, and more engaging content, we better serve user intent and position our site as a more authoritative resource.
