            "question": "Can I get the lunch menu on weekends?",
            "answer": "Sadly, no. The lunch-sized portions and prices are a weekday-only treat (Mon-Fri before 3 PM). Weekends are for going big with the dinner menu! 😉"

          },
          {
            "question": "Can I order the lunch specials for takeout?",
            "answer": "Yes, you can! Olive Garden offers their lunch specials for takeout, so you can enjoy a delicious and affordable Italian lunch at your desk or at home. Just be aware that the 'unlimited' part of the soup, salad, and breadsticks deal doesn't apply to takeout orders."
