Well, not exactly, and that's what makes it legendary! üçù Olive Garden is the king of American-Italian comfort food. Think endless breadsticks, giant bowls of pasta, and that famous salad. It's the place you go for a family dinner, a date night, or when you just need a hug in the form of carbs. Founded in 1982, it's become an American icon for a reason: consistently delicious, super welcoming, and always a good time. So grab a seat, and let's get this bread (stick)!</p>"
