            "question": "Do you have a separate fryer for allergens?",
            "answer": "No, we do not have a separate fryer at this time. This means any food that is fried can come in contact with major allergens like wheat, shellfish, dairy, soy, and egg. Please inform your server of any allergies!"

            "question": "What is the gluten-free pasta made of?",
            "answer": "Our gluten-free rotini pasta is made primarily from brown rice flour, which gives it a great texture that's very close to traditional pasta."
          },
          {
            "question": "Is the Italian salad dressing gluten-free?",
            "answer": "There are no gluten-containing ingredients in the dressing itself. However, gluten is present in the facility where it's made. When you order, please request 'no croutons' to make the salad fully gluten-sensitive."
          },
          {
            "question": "Do you use MSG in your food?",
            "answer": "We do not add any MSG to our recipes. However, some ingredients like tomatoes, cheeses, and mushrooms naturally contain glutamate. "
          },
          {
            "question": "Are there any vegan options available?",
            "answer": "Yes! Our famous breadsticks (ask for them without the butter brush) and marinara sauce are vegan. You can create a delicious vegan pasta dish. The Minestrone soup is also a great vegan choice!"
